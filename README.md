## 🚀 Overview

**Update Revit Titleblocks** is a .NET 8 solution designed to automate the process of updating title blocks in Autodesk Revit projects.

---

## 📦 Solution Projects

### **RevitAutomationUpdateTitleblocks**

This is a **Revit Add-in project** designed to work with the Autodesk Design Automation API. It contains the core logic for updating title blocks in Revit files and is intended to be executed in the cloud via the Design Automation service. The add-in is packaged and uploaded as a bundle for remote execution.

### **LocalDebug**

This project is designed to enable **local testing and debugging** of the `RevitAutomationUpdateTitleblocks` add-in. It provides a local harness to simulate the Design Automation environment, allowing you to run and debug the add-in directly within Visual Studio and Revit, without deploying to the cloud.
